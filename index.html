    <p>
      I have always enjoyed reading ever since I was a child.
      I started reading when I was 10 years old and since then I have read about a hundred books. <br>
      My first book was assigned to me at school and it was Fahrenheit 451 written by Ray Bradbury.
      It was thanks to this book that my passion for reading was born and it continues to this day. <br>
      With this site, I would like to transmit to you the passion and curiosity I have for books. 
      On this page I have listed my top 5 books read since then, I hope you enjoy it.
