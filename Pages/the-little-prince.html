    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A pilot crashes in the Sahara Desert and encounters a strange young boy who calls himself the Little Prince. 
      The Little Prince has traveled there from his home on a lonely, distant asteroid with a single rose.<br>
      The story that follows is a beautiful and at times heartbreaking meditation on human nature.
      The Little Prince is one of the best-selling and most translated books of all time, universally cherished by children and adults alike,
      and Richard Howard's translation of the beloved classic beautifully reflects Saint-Exupéry's unique and gifted style, 
      bringing the English text as close as possible to the French in language, style, and spirit.
